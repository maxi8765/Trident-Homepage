Intro
Has your app-timed event grown too big?
Is your DIY equipment too complicated and limiting your growth?
Is your timing equipment nearing end of life?
Do you want to add capacity, time more events, and grow revenue?

Overview
Trident readers are professional RFID chip readers designed for endurance event timing. The platform is built as an open system. You bring your own timing software. You can use any cloud data ingestion system, or use ours. You bring your own UHF tags if you want. Trident supplies RFID chip readers, mats, UHF tags, reusable active HF tags, and data ingestion without proprietary lock-in. The system reduces labour, lowers operational risk, and scales from small events to mass participation and extreme environments.
Trident has supplied RFID timing equipment to professional timers since 2016 for mass participation events worldwide. The equipment has delivered reliable, accurate, and precise timing with reduced labour requirements and fewer timing errors.

Products
RFID Chip Readers
Trident RFID chip readers are available in passive UHF and active HF models with the same hardware platform and user experience.
Reader size: 3.8 × 7.3 × 4.1 inches.
Reader mass: 4.75 lb (1.7 kg).
Readers are IP68 waterproof, battery powered, single-button operated, with LED and buzzer feedback. Firmware and configuration updates are delivered over the air. Readers are compatible with any timing software.

Mats and Antennas
Fold-up UHF mats for rapid deployment and transport.
Roll-up UHF mats for flexible timing line width and uneven terrain.
Roll-up active HF mats for triathlon, swimming, mud, and wet conditions.
Optional side antennas and expandable configurations to increase detection width. All mats are lightweight, non-slip, and configurable for road, grass, or trail use.

Tags
UHF systems are unlocked and operate with standard EPC Gen2 UHF tags from any supplier. Trident also supplies validated UHF bib tags if required.
Active HF systems use reusable shoe tags and multisport tags. HF tags are waterproof, designed for extreme environments, and support multi-year reuse.

Mobile App
Trident is managed through a browser-based progressive web app. No local software is required. The app is used to configure RFID readers, monitor status, manage connectivity, apply firmware updates, and route data. Operators select their preferred timing software and data ingestion endpoint during setup. Real-time timing data and telemetry are forwarded using open, documented protocols.

Comparison
UHF is designed for mass participation running and cycling where low tag cost and high throughput are required. Tags are disposable and sourced from any supplier.
Active HF is designed for higher accuracy and environmental robustness. It performs reliably through water, mud, and dense athlete packs using reusable waterproof tags.
Both technologies run on the same RFID readers, app, and integration model, allowing mixed deployments without added operational complexity.
